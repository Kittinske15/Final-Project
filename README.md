## Brief :
This program is like a restaurant system simulator; ordering a menu, adding or removing a menu, 
can access as an admin or normal employee, daily sales report.

## Detailed description :
The program function:

-Firstly, starting with login, login as an employee or an admin can access different functions.

-The restaurant size will first start with 40 tables but later on can be modified by admin user.

-When a table ordered a menu, beverage type of menu goes into the bar and the food goes into the hotside.

 (imagine that the list from that table is printed to each kitchen for chef.)
 
 -Last but not least, checking bills, print out a bill with tax, change, time, and a phrase.
 
 -Finally, when closing the program, daily sale report is print out (thoroughly).

## How does it use you learning in this course :
Arraylist and arrays : collecting menu list, employee list, order from each table.

Object Oriented design and Programing : improve ways to collect data.

Nested loop and loop : apply the loop for the whole restaurant ( which the main loop is login and logout ).

Methods: to simplify the code.

UI(User interface) : to interact the program.
