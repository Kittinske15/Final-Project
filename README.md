## Brief :
This program is like a restaurant system simulator; ordering a menu, adding or removing a menu, 
can access as an admin or normal employee, daily sales report.

## Detailed description :
The program function:

-Firstly, starting with login, login as an employee or an admin can access different functions.
-The restaurant size will first start with 40 tables but later on can be modified by admin user.
-When a table ordered a menu, beverage type of menu goes into the bar and the food goes into the hotside.
 (imagine that the list from that table is printed to each kitchen for chef.)
 -Last but not least, checking bills, print out a bill with tax, change, time, and a phrase.
 -Finally, when closing the program, daily sale report is print out (thoroughly).
